    title: "Overview of Hidden Lines and Visible Surface Methods",
    description:
      "Hidden line and surface methods are essential for rendering 3D scenes accurately by determining which parts of objects should be visible from a specific viewpoint. Techniques like Z-buffering, depth-sorting, and scan-line algorithms are commonly used to handle this task. Mastering these methods is crucial in creating realistic and complex visual representations in graphics, ensuring clarity and depth in 3D models.",

    title: "Fundamentals of Curve Generation",
    description:
      "Curve generation is the backbone of smooth and natural shape design in computer graphics. From Bezier curves to B-splines, these mathematical techniques allow us to create and manipulate curves for 2D and 3D graphics. Curves are used in applications like character modeling, animation, and even in path generation for simulations. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for creating elegant, organic shapes in a digital space.",
